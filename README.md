Twt
===

A twitter client that _I_ feel comfortable with on desktop and mobile browsers. I like Dabr(you can infer my
tastes), but it can be vastly improved.

Ideas
-----

UI

*   panel of toggle switches for special controls like...
*   an "auto update/notify" switch
*   infinite scroll/no infinite scroll switch
*   api request limit/currently used count

Notes
-----

*   js catch for replies on capable browsers. just use form on timeline to compose instead of re-loading whole thing.
